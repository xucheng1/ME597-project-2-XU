In discussing Figure 1, the authors state the data are from the “Flow of
Funds Accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve.” The note in the
figure states “Source: Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Data; Bureau of
Economic Analysis”. I googled the latter and found a [data download
program](https://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=Z1).
Using the Build Your Package feature I was able to find real estate
assets owned by households with values similar to those in Table 1.

For Table 2, I went to a [Robert Schiller
website](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm) and clicked on the
link for US home prices 1890-present which downloaded a spreadsheet that
had data similar to that in Figure 2. This may not be exactly what you
need, but it shows me that you could be more thorough in your search for
the raw data than you have been so far. The spreadsheet also includes a
column for the CPI. The CPI is a standard tool for adjusting dollar
amounts for inflation. There will be numerous explanations online how to
use it.

I have two suggestions:

  - be more thorough in your own searches; and
  - ask our reference librarians for assistance.

Obtaining the original data isn’t easy but it is part of your
responsibility for the project.

## Problem with the data acquisition part

1.  The website <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPGDPAI> is a
    possible website for the data of the figure 1 in the original
    report. However, it is not quarterly and the earliest data is 2005
    while in the original article, it uses the data from 1972 to 2012.

2.  For the Table 1, author says the source for this table is
    <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/>. However, I could not download the
    data of “Real Estate” on the website
    <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/OEHRENWBSHNO>. Also, author is
    not clear about how those numbers in the table come from.

3.  For the figure 2 in the original report, I did find the data of S\&P
    Case Shiller

4.  For the figure 3 in the original report, I did find the data of FHFA
    Housing Price Index (All Transactions) on the website
    <https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx#qat>.
    However there are many types of it on this website. Author does not
    mention which type he is using for “All Transactions”.

5.  For the figure 4,5,6,7 in the original report, author mentioned “the
    Fiserv Case Shiller Index”. There is no such index on the website
    <https://us.spindices.com/indices/real-estate/sp-corelogic-case-shiller-10-city-composite-home-price-nsa-index#global-login>.
    Also there is no Case-Shiller index for Texas, California, Florida
    and Arizona. There is “Per Capita Personal Income” data on the
    website <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release?rid=151>. However, the
    data is only available for 1998 to 2017 (Sep 25). But in the
    original report, he used the data 1975 - 2012.

6.  For the figure 8,9,10, there are several sets of raw data: A)
    Housing Wealth. When I search for the data for “Current Population
    Survey and the 1990 and 2000 Census of Population and Housing”, I
    got the website <https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html>.
    However, there is no useful data (or no data at all) in the “data
    section” of the website. B) Retail Sales. Author said the website
    Moody’s Economy.com. However, it seems to me that it requires
    authorization for the data. C) Financial Wealth. Author said they
    use two bodies of data, but he does not tell me what final dataset
    he used in the figure. Also, when I search on the website
    <https://www.federalreserve.gov/default.htm>. Either there is no
    data or the earliest data is 2005 for corporate equities, pension
    fund reserves, and mutual funds. D) Personal Income. Even I register
    an account on the website <https://www.moodys.com/> I could not find
    any income data for the states (e.g. California) on this website.

7.  Finally, at the end of page 17, author mentioned “deflation using
    the CPI”. I never see he used it or how this CPI related to the
    figures 8 through 10.
